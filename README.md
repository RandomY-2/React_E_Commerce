# React E-Commerce Store

### [View](https://inspiring-jackson-2ed468.netlify.app/)

In this repository, I created an e-commerce store using React and commerce.js. The website is connected to my commerce.js store and is capable of fetching and displaying the products I have in my store and updating the cart based on what users want to buy in real-time. I followed this [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=377AQ0y6LPA) to create the project.
